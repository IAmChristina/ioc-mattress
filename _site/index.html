      <p>You spend a third of your life in bed. We make that time healthier, more comfortable and even a touch bouncier than other memory foam mattresses, which is kinda fun. Our mattresses are safely made for you without using any ozone depleters, PBDEs, TDCPP, mercury, or lead. If you run into a defect that falls under the warranty in the first 10 years, we will replace or repair it and get you back to sleeping right.</p>

      <p>We created our Memory Adaptive foam to feel comfortable and provide great pressure relief  without feeling too  soft or like quicksand. Without support, a mattress may only be comfortable for a few hours. Our 7-inch support layer provides the ideal base for a full night’s sleep. In addition to the heat wicking graphite and cooling gel in our Adaptive foam, our cover is extremely breathable to keep you cool.</p>
